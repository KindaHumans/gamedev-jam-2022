# Toaster's Revenge
A game made for GameDev.tv Game Jam 2022 - "Death is only the beginning"

You, the protagonist ghost who died in what was probably a toaster-related incident, are attempting to defend your now vacant house from interlopers who we're pretty sure are all really bad people so you can feel justified killing them. In fact, they're maybe the ones who killed you, hence the title "Toaster's Revenge". 

Possess objects (currently only sink and toaster are possessible objects) to lure these home intruders to their untimely demise, and also make a bunch of delicious toast in the process.
